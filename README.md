OVERVIEW

In an ideal situation an undisturbed forest would rest on top of a groundwater recharge area, and the degree of protection would depend on the size of the area necessary for (instance) 150 years of protection. The larger the area, the longer protection - but also the higher the price. 

StrateGIS's original purpose is to create an interactive visual support for the difficult decisions related to strategic long-term investment in groundwater protection. StrateGIS is a GIS-based strategic tool developed to make Big Data understandable and manageable for decision makers and laymen alike.

StrateGIS consists of a spatial database populated with GIS-data, and a set of routines to "simplify" the meaning of the data into scores, and a Manager to handle the "layers" and relate the data to each other, so that a simplified map can be generated from a multitude of (possibly) interdependent datasets. 

Basically StrateGIS simplify the consequences of a long list of complicated data-sources into a map consisting of red, yellow and green squares, and attempts to equate the costs of the current project settings. The position and degree (score) of a data-layer can swiftly be set, changed, and managed in the accompanying DataManager, thereby possibly changing the value of a cell, and perhaps the neighbouring cells too. 

With StrateGIS you can show the complicated answer to "simple" questions like:

* "Where should we build a forest protect the groundwater?"

* "How much protection can we get for $200.000?"

* "How much protection do we actually get for the investment?"

* "What alternatives do we have?"


With StrateGIS you can change the parameters of the project and instantly see the result.

With StrateGIS you can track and manage the progress of very long-term projects (+10 years) distributed over large areas.
